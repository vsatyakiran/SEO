# Search Engine VS Web Browser

- **Search Engine:** Imagine a giant library catalog. A search engine is a website that helps you find information on the internet. It has a massive database of information about websites and their content. When you enter a search query, the search engine uses sophisticated algorithms to scour its database and return a list of the most relevant websites. Popular search engines include `Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.`

- **Web Browser:** Think of a web browser as a window to the internet. It's a software application you install on your device (computer, phone, tablet) that allows you to access and interact with websites. The browser retrieves information from websites based on their addresses (URLs) and displays it in a user-friendly format. You can navigate through webpages, click on links, watch videos, and fill out forms using your web browser. Common web browsers include `Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge.`
