All about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

`It is technique used to increase the traffic to your website.`

In simple terms, SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever people search for:

- Products you sell.
- Services you provide.
- Information on topics in which you have deep expertise and/or experience.

The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked on. Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to help attract website visitors who will become customers, clients or an audience that keeps coming back.

## What is marketing?

- “The action or business of promoting and selling products or services, including market research and advertising.” 

- That’s exactly what SEO is here for: to promote a company and to assist in the sales of products and services, including market (keyword/competitive) research.

# What to do for better SEO?

Some might say SEO involves meta data. Some might say “technical,” including things like addressing page speed. SEO is the process of building your business’s web presence to connect with consumers.

This process may begin with keyword research, but even that small task/deliverable is an involved process. 

- How do we want to position the business, its products and/or its services? 

- Which `competitors` seem most aligned to our aspirations and appear to be performing best against those keywords which we’ve identified? 

- Have we `identified keywords` – from all of our analysis – which we deem “very important”, yet we have no pages/content relevant enough to Google/searchers to fulfill the intent of the search? 

- How do we `cross-promote (link) content`, so that it might perform (rank) better?

# SEO vs. SEM

* SEM stands for `search engine marketing` – or, as it is more commonly known, search marketing. 

* Search marketing is the process of `gaining traffic` and visibility from search engines through `both paid and unpaid efforts`.

So how do SEO and SEM differ? Technically they aren’t different – SEO is simply one-half of SEM:

- SEO = driving organic traffic from search engines. 

- SEM = driving organic and paid traffic from search engines. 

# SEO vs. PPC

- PPC stands for `pay-per-click` – a type of digital marketing where advertisers are charged whenever one of their ads gets clicked on.

- Basically, advertisers bid on specific keywords or phrases that they want their ads to appear for in the search engine results. When a user searches for one of those keywords or phrases, the advertiser’s ad will appear among the top results.

# SERP
A Search Engine Results Page (SERP) is the page that a search engine displays to a user after they enter a search query. SERPs are important for search engine optimization (SEO) because ranking position on a SERP can be highly competitive and impact SEO traffic. Users are more likely to click on results at the top of the page, so poor ranking can lead to less exposure, clicks, traffic, and revenue.

Search Engine Results Page (SERP) The page that a search engine returns after a user submits a search query. In addition to organic search results, search engine results pages (SERPs) usually include paid search and pay-per-click (PPC) ads. Thanks to search engine optimization (SEO), ranking position on a SERP can be highly competitive since users are more likely to click on results at the top of the page. With the launch of schema markup, SERPs are becoming much more complex to try to anticipate user needs.

# Why is SEO important?

- SEO is a critical marketing channel. First, and foremost: organic search delivers 53% of all website traffic.

- search is incredibly fragmented. Users may search on traditional web search engines (e.g., Google, Microsoft Bing), social platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok) or retailer websites (e.g., Amazon). 

In fact, 61% of U.S. online shoppers start their product search on Amazon, compared to 49% who start on a search engine like Google. Also of note from that same research: 

* 32% start on Walmart.com.

* 20% start on YouTube.

* 19% start on Facebook.

* 15% start on Instagram.

* 11% start on TikTok.

# Types of SEO

There are three types of SEO:

* `Technical SEO:` Optimizing the technical aspects of a website.

* `On-site SEO:` Optimizing the content on a website for users and search engines.

* `Off-site SEO:` Creating brand assets (e.g., ​​people, marks, values, vision, slogans, catchphrases, colors) and doing things that will ultimately enhance brand awareness and recognition (i.e., demonstrating and growing its expertise, authority and trustworthiness) and demand generation.

# Technical optimization

Optimizing the technical elements of a website is crucial and fundamental for SEO success. 

Experience is also a critical element of technical optimization. Search engines stress the importance of pages that load quickly and provide a good user experience

Another area of technical optimization is structured data (a.k.a., schema). Adding this code to your website can help search engines better understand your content and enhance your appearance in the search results. 

# Content optimization

your content needs to be optimized for two primary audiences: `people and search engines.`

What this means is that you optimize the content your audience will see (what’s actually on the page) as well as what search engines will see (the code).

When optimizing content for people, you should make sure it:

- Is better than your SERP competitors.

- Includes multimedia (e.g., images, videos).

- Is well-written and free of grammatical and spelling errors.

- Includes keywords people would use to find the content.

- Covers relevant topics with which you have experience or expertise.

# What crawler or spider looks?

- `Title tags`
  
- `Meta description`
  
- `Header tags (H1-H6)`
  
- `Image alt text Open`

- `first line of the content`
  
- `graph and Twitter Cards metadata`

# Off-site optimization

- `Social media marketing and optimization:` Claim your brand’s handle on any and all relevant platforms, optimize it fully and share relevant content. 

- `Content marketing:` Some popular forms include creating videos, ebooks, research studies, podcasts (or being a guest on other podcasts) and guest posting (or guest blogging).

- `Brand building and brand marketing:` Techniques designed to boost recognition and reputation


# 1. Understanding how search engines work

-`Crawling:` Search engines use crawlers to discover pages on the web by following links and using sitemaps.

- `Rendering:` Search engines generate how the page will look using HTML, JavaScript and CSS information.

- `Indexing:` Search engines analyze the content and metadata of the pages it has discovered and add them to a database (though there’s no guarantee every page on your website will be indexed).

- `Ranking:` Complex algorithms look at a variety of signals to determine whether a page is relevant and of high-enough quality to show when searchers enter a query.
